  abstract = {Ideology has re-emerged as an important topic of inquiry among social,

	recent theory and research concerning the structure, contents, and
	functions of ideological belief systems. We begin by defining the
	construct and placing it in historical and philosophical context.
	We then examine different perspectives on how many (and what types
	of) dimensions individuals use to organize their political opinions.
	We investigate (a) how and to what extent individuals acquire the
	discursive contents associated with various ideologies, and (b) the
	social-psychological functions that these ideologies serve for those
	who adopt them. Our review highlights "elective affinities" between
	situational and dispositional needs of individuals and groups and
	the structure and contents of specific ideologies. Finally, we consider
	the consequences of ideology, especially with respect to attitudes,
	evaluations, and processes of system justification.},
