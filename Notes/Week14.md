# Week 14 Notes #
December 4, 2013

## It's our last week! ##

So celebrate!

## Assignment ##
Please write a 500-word essay that addresses the following topic:

>The readings from the first week of class offered optimistic ideas about the role of citizens and the representation of their opinions in democracies. We have since read more skeptical perspectives about the capacity and motivation of citizens and the opportunities (and normative desirability) for their opinions to shape government action. Given what you've learned from the course as a whole, how can we reconcile these divergent views? And what theories and evidence can we use toward that goal?

Send your essay to the two other members of your group and to the instructor by 12:00 (noon) on Tuesday. In class, you will provide feedback to each other in groups on each other's essays.

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

## Riker ##
* One of the most prominent critiques of majority rule is the idea of "majority tyranny," where minority groups' rights are infringed by a stable majority of the public. Is Riker concerned about majority tyranny? Why or why not? (233-234)
* On p.236, Riker argues that voting is not fair. On what grounds does he argue this? What does he see as the fundamental problem in aggregating preferences? (This relates to the ideas from the previous chapters that we have read from him.)
 * Riker focuses on voting for discussing the aggregation of preferences. To what extent do his claims about voting extend to the realm of opinion measurement in general (e.g., through public opinion polls)? Are polls able to fairly represent public opinion?
* Riker discusses two kinds of ways that voting systems can be manipulated. (236--238) What are they? And what consequences do they have for social choice?
* Riker provides a very succinct definition of "populism" on p.238. What is it?
* Why does he reject populism? (238--239)
* *Note: Do not worry about the discussion of U.S. elections on pp.239--241*
* On p.242, Riker provides a succinct definition of "liberalism". What is it?
* In point 4 on p.243, Riker describes a situation in which a candidate has offended a majority of the public and yet is somehow reelected. Does Riker feel this is a violation of the liberal interpretation of voting? Why or why?
 * In your own view, is Riker's view a satisfying notion of democracy?
* What citizen capacities does Riker's liberal view of democracy require? Does it require, e.g., knowledge, well-formed opinions, aggregate coherence of public opinion, etc.? (esp. 244--45)
* Riker is concerned (e.g., on pp.246--47) about the use of elections (or public opinion in general) to symbolize a "popular will." How does this compare to Herbst's discussions of the strategic use of public opinion as a symbol?
* Which model of democracy - liberalism or populism - does Riker believe most likely to devolve into tyranny? Why? (247--49)
* Riker argues that liberalism alone does not defend democracy (i.e., citizens' having a veto is not sufficient). He argues that democracy also requires constitutional/institutional restraint (i.e., institutions which slow policymaking and prevent populist action). How credible is this view?


## Hibbing and Theiss-Morse ##
* *Note: This is written in the context of American politics, but its normative discussions are universal.*
* The authors lay out four models of democratic procedures (which reflect agenda-setting and decision-making processes). How do these compare to "liberalism" and "populism" as defined by Riker? (164--69)
* The authors focus quite a bit on social capital theory. What is social capital and what impacts does it allegedly have on society? (169--72)
* Next, Hibbing and Theiss-Morse discuss deliberative democracy (something we haven't spent much time on, but that we've seen in Mansbridge's text and others). What benefits does deliberation allegedly have? (172--181)
* *Note: The second chapter we read (Chapter 8) reviews some of the empirical contributions of the book, in response to the normative discussions of Chapter 7. In short, the authors conducted a number of studies to understand what the (American) public thinks about deliberation, citizen involvement, democracy, government decision-making, etc. Their findings, as you will see, are that citizens' preferences over democratic institutions do not conform very closely to the normative ideas summarized in the previous chapter. Their conclusions is that citizens prefer "stealth democracy," essentially giving limitless authority to policymakers provided that those policymakers do not act exclusively in their own self-interest.*
* If democratic theory demanding greater citizen involvement and greater deliberation conflicts with citizens' preferences over processes (i.e., citizens do not want deliberation), should we follow normative theory or citizens' preferences?
 * Are citizens' opinions about democratic processes worth listening to? Why or why?
 * If empirical evidence suggests that citizens and society are not better off with direct democratic institutions, is this because of a failure of the institutions (as Riker would argue) or a failure of the people to properly and adequately engage with politics?

## Sniderman et al. ##
*You can find the reading here: [Sniderman et al. Chapter 2](../SnidermanCh2.pdf)*

* *Note: The Sniderman et al. reading is an excerpt from a forthcoming book about the Danish Muhammad cartoon crisis. It is the only "case study" that we read for the class. Why? Because it asks us to consider the tensions between core ideas in public opinion: public sentiment, democratic theory, tolerance, minority and majority groups, etc.*
* How do Danes view "Muslims" versus "Islamic fundamentalists"? Are the measures reported, e.g., in Table 2.2, evidence of Danish toleration of Muslims or not?
* Is toleration of minority groups necessary for democracy? How tolerated are different minority and fringe groups in Denmark? How tolerant are Danes in general?
* If groups pose a threat to democratic or liberal norms (e.g., demanding special accommodation) or to democratic institutions (e.g., by introducing religious requirements into state activities), should their voices be permitted?
* What impact did the cartoon crisis have on support for civil liberties (not just of Muslims, but of all the studied groups)?
* One of the basic principles of Dahl's notion of democracy is that citizens can and do know their own interests and thus their opinions should be accepted on face value. If those opinions contain what others see as objectionable content - anti-semitism, intolerance, etc. - what place do those opinions have in democracy?
* What conclusion to Sniderman et al. reach about the cartoon crisis? Did Danes' opinions of Muslims behave as they "ought"?


## Bachrach and Baratz ##
Peter Bachrach and Morton S. Baratz. 1962. "Two Faces of Power" *American Political Science Review* 56(4):947--952.

This is a very short, but seminal piece of political science literature. It is relevant to today's discussions, as they relate to questions about who has power in collective decision making and whether that power is indeed observable.
