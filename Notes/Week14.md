# Week 14 Notes #
December 4, 2013

## It's our last week! ##

So celebrate!

## Assignment ##
Please write a 500-word essay that addresses the following topic:

>The readings from the first week of class offered optimistic ideas about the role of citizens and the representation of their opinions in democracies. We have since read more skeptical perspectives about the capacity and motivation of citizens and the opportunities (and normative desirability) for their opinions to shape government action. Given what you've learned from the course as a whole, how can we reconcile these divergent views? And what theories and evidence can we use toward that goal?

Send your essay to the two other members of your group and to the instructor by 12:00 (noon) on Tuesday. In class, you will provide feedback to each other in groups on each other's essays.

## Bachrach and Baratz ##
Peter Bachrach and Morton S. Baratz. 1962. "Two Faces of Power" *American Political Science Review* 56(4):947--952.

This is a very short, but seminal piece of political science literature. It is relevant to today's discussions, as they relate to questions about who has power in collective decision making and whether that power is indeed observable.
