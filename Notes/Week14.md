# Week 14 Notes #
December 4, 2013

## It's our last week! ##

So celebrate!

## Assignment ##
Please write a 500-word essay that addresses the following topic:

>The readings from the first week of class offered optimistic ideas about the role of citizens and the representation of their opinions in democracies. We have since read more skeptical perspectives about the capacity and motivation of citizens and the opportunities (and normative desirability) for their opinions to shape government action. Given what you've learned from the course as a whole, how can we reconcile these divergent views? And what theories and evidence can we use toward that goal?

Send your essay to the two other members of your group and to the instructor by 12:00 (noon) on Tuesday. In class, you will provide feedback to each other in groups on each other's essays.

## General questions ##

* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

## Riker ##
* One of the most prominent critiques of majority rule is the idea of "majority tyranny," where minority groups' rights are infringed by a stable majority of the public. Is Riker concerned about majority tyranny? Why or why not? (233-234)
* On p.236, Riker argues that voting is not fair. On what grounds does he argue this? What does he see as the fundamental problem in aggregating preferences? (This relates to the ideas from the previous chapters that we have read from him.)
 * Riker focuses on voting for discussing the aggregation of preferences. To what extent do his claims about voting extend to the realm of opinion measurement in general (e.g., through public opinion polls)? Are polls able to fairly represent public opinion?
* Riker discusses two kinds of ways that voting systems can be manipulated. (236--238) What are they? And what consequences do they have for social choice?
* Riker provides a very succinct definition of "populism" on p.238. What is it?
* Why does he reject populism? (238--239)
* *Note: Do not worry about the discussion of U.S. elections on pp.239--241*
* On p.242, Riker provides a succinct definition of "liberalism". What is it?
* In point 4 on p.243, Riker describes a situation in which a candidate has offended a majority of the public and yet is somehow reelected. Does Riker feel this is a violation of the liberal interpretation of voting? Why or why?
 * In your own view, is Riker's view a satisfying notion of democracy?
* What citizen capacities does Riker's liberal view of democracy require? Does it require, e.g., knowledge, well-formed opinions, aggregate coherence of public opinion, etc.? (esp. 244--45)
* Riker is concerned (e.g., on pp.246--47) about the use of elections (or public opinion in general) to symbolize a "popular will." How does this compare to Herbst's discussions of the strategic use of public opinion as a symbol?
* Which model of democracy - liberalism or populism - does Riker believe most likely to devolve into tyranny? Why? (247--49)
* Riker argues that liberalism alone does not defend democracy (i.e., citizens' having a veto is not sufficient). He argues that democracy also requires constitutional/institutional restraint (i.e., institutions which slow policymaking and prevent populist action). How credible is this view?
## Hibbing and Theiss-Morse ##


## Sniderman et al. ##
You can find the reading here: [Sniderman et al. Chapter 2](../SnidermanCh2.pdf)


## Bachrach and Baratz ##
Peter Bachrach and Morton S. Baratz. 1962. "Two Faces of Power" *American Political Science Review* 56(4):947--952.

This is a very short, but seminal piece of political science literature. It is relevant to today's discussions, as they relate to questions about who has power in collective decision making and whether that power is indeed observable.
