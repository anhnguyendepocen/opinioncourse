# Week 14 Notes #
December 4, 2013

## It's our last week! ##

So celebrate!

## Assignment ##
Please write a 500-word, printed (i.e. on paper) essay that addresses the following topic:

>The readings from the first week of class offered optimistic ideas about the role of citizens and the representation of their opinions in democracies. This week's readings were more skeptical about the capacity and motivation of citizens and the opportunities (and normative desirability) for their opinions to shape government action. Given what you've learned from the course as a whole, how can we reconcile these divergent views? And what theories and evidence can we use toward that goal?

Send the essay to the two other members of your group. In class, you will provide feedback to each other in groups on each other's essays.
