# Notes for "What is public Opinion?"
September 11, 2013

## General questions
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


## Herbst
* What are the two values of public opinion that Herbst describes? (30)
	* Instrumental and symbolic
* What are the definitions of public opinion she finds in the extant literature? (44)
	* Collective view of elites
	* Views of the active/interested (those who participate)
	* Formally (44):
		* Aggregation (from Gallup)
		* Majoritarian (from Lowell)
		* Discursive/consensual (from Aristotle (49), Rousseau's "collective will" (37), Locke, and Noelle-Neuman)
		* Reification/Phantom (from Lippmann), perhaps as a symbol only

* How does Herbst think public opinion can be used as a symbol?
	* "Symbols are meaningful because of their social resonance" (33)
	* Producing "diffuse system support" via legitimation (34--35)

* How does quantified public opinion differ from other definitions of public opinion? (esp. 38)
	* Public versus private
	* Active versus passive
	* Representative/fair versus self-selected/biased
	* Quantitative versus qualititative
	* Single versus multiple forms of expression
	* Collective versus individual

* Is the quantified view of public opinion limiting? Does it lead us to miss anything important? What are its advantages over other techniques (48,61)?
	* Herbst mentions Ginsberg (47) who is concerned that public opinion "domesticates" the public. Do voting and the sample survey have negative impacts on democracy?
	* Did everyone understand the different techniques? Was there any confusion about any of them?

* Herbst says that "for elected officials, understanding the popular sentiment is part of their job" (39). Thinking of Mansbridge's types of representation, which type is Herbst thinking of? (Mansbridge 520)
* Herbst talks about the reasons public opinion data are collected for reasons other than representation (39). What implications does strategic use of public opinion have for understanding of its role in democracy, particular in light of Dahl's view that enlightened, expressed preferences are the foundation for democracy?
* If public opinion data are collected for strategic or symbolic reasons, what implication does that have for our use or analysis of that information for scientific or political ends?
* Herbst talks about how public opinion quantification is often used to initiate or advance political debate (42). How does this compare to Dahl's view of opinion aggregation (e.g., through voting) as the outcome of a democratic process?
* How do Dahl and Herbst each view the role of public opinion in democracy?
	* For whom is public opinion instrumental and for whom is it symbolic? (Herbst, 37)
	* Elections are a relatively recent innovation for capturing public opinion, but central to Dahl and Downs's theories of democracy
* Dahl places a large emphasis on the question of competence: who is competent to participate? Does competence appear anywhere in Herbst's discussion? Why or why not?


## Downs
* How does Downs define individual rationality? (4) What are the key facets of assessing rationality? (5)
	* How does Downs' definition of rationality relate to Dahl's requirement that citizens know their own interest? Can citizens know their own interests? Why or why not?
		* Downs acknowledges that people can make errors (9) but says that isn't irrationality because it could just be bad information.
		* Downs defines rationality as striving toward selfish ends? Is this also what Dahl means by knowing what is best for one's self?
		* How important is being informed for citizens in Downs' and Dahl's views?
	* Downs states five formal assumptions about rationality (6):
		1. always makes a decision
		2. all alternatives can be ranked
		3. transitivity
		4. always chooses the highest ranked option
		5. always decides the same way within a choice set
	* How plausible are Downs' assumptions and his definition of rationality?
		* What does Dahl think people should do in an irrational world? (10)
	* Downs assumes interest are fixed (47). What implications does this have for political debate?

* Downs assumes that the goal of democracy is to form a government (i.e., to delegate) (7). How does this compare to Dahl's definition of democracy? And how does it relate to Mansbridge's types of representation?
* Downs also offers a formal definition of government according to 8 principles (23--24). How does this compare to Dahl's definition of democracy?
* How does Downs' view of parties' goals (11, 30, and the means toward obtaining those goals, 28) compare with any of Mansbridge's models of representation?
	* If we additionally think about Downs' model of voting (esp.38-45), what types of representation is Downs talking about?
	* Downs talks about utility in general as the basis for representation (i.e., voters maximize all benefits they can obtain from government). Is this also what Mansbridge is talking about when she defines four types of representation or is she talking about something else?
	* How important are retrospective and prospective voting in Downs' model? When does a voter rely on each (44)? Are these credible claims?
	* Does Downs' model allow voters to set the agenda and debate (as Dahl emphasizes, Dahl 107) or is their role in democracy more limited?
		* What implications do these differences have for how we thinking about the role of public opinion in democracy?
		* How does Downs' view of the public's role in democracy compare to the various definitions of public opinion raised by Herbst?

* Does Dahl talk about parties? Why are parties so important to Downs' model? How does he define parties (24--25)?

* What does Downs say the goal of every government or party is? (11) Is this a credible assumption?
	* Does Dahl make any assumptions or claims about the strategic goals of individuals, parties, or governments?
  
* Is Downs engaged social science (33--35)? Does he have any empirics?


## Dahl
* What is Dahl's "strong principle of equality" (97--98)?
	* Who is included and who is excluded from Dahl's definition, and on what grounds? (esp. ch9, 127)
		* Age (122--123)
		* Competence (124--126)
		* Citizenship (128)
		* Others?
* Dahl emphasizes "competence" and "qualification". What do these mean? How would we measure them?

* Dahl assumes that each individual is best able to judge their own interests (99--100)? How does this compare to Downs' definition of rationality?
	* When might people not be able to judge their own interests?
	* How do we know what is best for us? Are we born knowing what is best?

* What are Dahl's criteria for democracy?
	* Effective participation (i.e., preference expression, 109)
	* Voting equality (109--110); note that he does not specify any particular method of voting (e.g., majority rule)
	* Enlightened understanding (111)
		* Dahl requires that citizens have "adequate" and "equal" opportunity to deciding which political alternatives are best (112). How would know what is adequate and equal? Can we observe this empirically?
		* Dahl later focuses on the importance of "equal opportunity" (114--15). Does obtaining that standard require any modifications to democratic practice (e.g., economic redistribution)?
	* Agenda control (112--114)
		* How does this compare to Mansbridge's and Downs' models of democratic participation? Do they require citizens to have agenda control?
* Can democracy - by Dahl's definition - ever exist?

* Dahl's model is an "ideal" model of democracy (i.e., what *should* democracy look like). If democracy doesn't actually look like this, can we still talk about public opinion? For example, if citizens have inequal opportunity, some are excluded, some are misinformed, or some do not participate, what does public opinion mean?
	
* Downs talks about democracy in terms of individuals' and parties' strategic incentives and how those operate through elections. Dahl talks about democracy in terms of basic principles of inclusion and governmental procedure. What does each perspective get right and wrong?


## Mansbridge
* What are the four types of representation addressed by Mansbridge? Can we think of any others?
	* Promissory (mandate versus trustee distinction, 516)
	* Anticipatory
		* How does this relate to Herbst's thoughts on the use of public opinion and Downs' views about the goals of governments/parties?
	* Gyroscopic
		* How do promissory (mandate and trustee) and gyroscopic differ? (521)
	* Surrogate
* Are Mansbridge's types single-issue, multi-issue, or something else?
* Where does public opinion come into these models of representation? Is it only at elections, some other time(s), or not at all?
* How do these types mesh with the views of democracy offered by Herbst, Dahl, and Downs?
* If voters can be manipulated (e.g., by anticipatory representatives), what does this say about Dahl's and Downs' assumptions about voters knowing their self-interest?
* If our goal is empirically to see whether public opinion matters, how do the different models shape the way that we would go about looking for the impact of opinion on legislative behavior?
