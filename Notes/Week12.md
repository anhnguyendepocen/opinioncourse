# Week 12 Notes #
November 20, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

*Note: Please read Ch.1 and Ch.5 from Riker (from last week's reading list).*
*Note: Do not read the Erikson article. I will just discuss its main contributions during seminar.*

## Riker ##
*Read Chapters 1 and 5 in compendium*

* Riker is talking about "social choice theory." What is it?
* What is the "paradox of voting" (or Condorcet paradox)? (1--2, 16--19)
 * What (two) assumptions are made in establishing the paradox?
 * How credible is the preference assumption in light of what we know about opinion formation?
 * If individuals have transitive preferences, are social choices necessarily transitive? Are they necessarily intransitive? Does the paradox make predictions about how preferences aggregate to a social choice?
* What does Riker say are the three core elements of democracy? (5)
 * What does Riker say the relationship is between voting and democracy (5)
 * Does Riker think liberty is necessary or sufficient for democracy? Instrumental or symbolic? (6--7)
* What are the key differences between the "liberal" and "populist" interpetations of voting? (8--14)
 * Does either interpretation assume that the public's views are inherently correct or a normatively (or morally) better basis for government action? (10, 14; think also about Dahl)
* Riker asks "Can the democartic ideal be attained if hte method used to attain it produces confusion" (18). What do you think?
* What is Arrow's theorem? (116) What are its six "fairness" conditions? (116--119) How well do these capture "fairness"?
 * Can any method that satisfies the conditiongs guarantee a social ordering (i.e., a social choice)?
* What are "cycles" and why can they occur? (120)
* What implications does cycling have for representation? Can we ever observe representation in a world where social choices cycle?
* As the number of voters in an electorate increase, how likely is there to be a condorcet winner? What about as the number of alternatives increase? (121--122)
* Under what conditions can a stable social choice be obtained? (124)
 * *Note: Pages 123--128 are a bit technical, so don't worry about the details.*
 * In Section 5.E, Riker concludes that the only fairness condition that can be relaxed (and thus produce a social choice) is transitivity. What implications does he say relaxing this condition would have? (130--132)
* Riker critiques the idea of "collective rationality" (132) saying that it is "an illgetimate anthropomorphism." Page and Shapiro defend the idea of collective rationality empirically. Who is right?
* Riker makes the assumption, throughout the text, that opinions are stable. If opinions are unstable (either because they fluctuate randomly or because they are systematically responsive to politics), what implications would this have for social choice?
* Riker concludes that so long as the fairness criteria are non-satisfiable, social choice is not possible. What role, then, should the public's views have in government?


## Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson ##
* The authors focus on "dynamic representation." How do they define it and how does it correspond, if at all, to any of the models of representation outlined by Mansbridge?
* How do the authors conceptualize the causal influence of opinion on policy? (543) What do they say needs to be shown in order to demonstrate influence?
* What mechanism is proposed for connnecting opinion to policy? (544) Is it universal or conditional?
 * How does their proposed mechanism of influence "feel"? Does it feel like democracy at work?
* *Note: Do not worry about the specifics of the statistics.*
* The authors rely on a general (i.e., not issue-specific) measure of public opinion called "policy mood". (548) What is it? How does it relate to "macropartisanship" (from last week)?
 * What are the advantages and disadvantages of this aggregated measure of opinion?
* What is their outcome variable? How is it measured? (549--550)
* What are the findings? (Look especially at the tables). How much does public opinion matter?
* The results in Table 5 and Figure 5 (556--558) aggregate across all outcomes. How responsive does government in general seem to be to public opinion?
 * See especially p.557: how closely related are opinion and policy?
* Overall, can these results be interpreted as normatively desirable? Why or why?
* In Week 8 we asked whether opinions should be responsive to outside political events and whether there was any evidence of such responsiveness. Here, we see that opinion should be something that policymakers should be responsive to. What then are the ultimate "inputs" to the political system?

## Jacobs and Page ##
* As is clear in the title, what is the research question underlying this paper? What do the authors want to know?
* What are the three views about who influences (U.S.) foreign policy? How do they differ? (107--109)
  * Which of these views involves the public as a whole? And what are the expectations thereof?
* In trying to assess whether the public's views of foreign policy matter, what do the authors highlight as the deficit in previous research? (109--110)
  * How does the data used here address that deficit?
* What is the outcome used here (i.e., the measure of influence)? (111)
* How correlated are the opinions of the public and the different elite groups? (113)
  * What impact might this have on the analysis?
  * What are the implications of high or low correlations? Does either make it easier to inference public influence?
* Which groups have the large influence on foreign policy (the public or another group)? (114--118; focus on the tables)
  * Don't worry about the secondary results (pp.118--120, Table 5)
* How credible are these results? How well do they show that the public and other groups had an influence on foreign policy?
* Can we generalize from this topic to other policy issues? And from this context to other countries? Why or why not?
* Jacobs and Page criticize Stimson et al. (121). How serious is their critique?
