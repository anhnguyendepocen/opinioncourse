# Week 12 Notes #
November 20, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

*Note: Please read Ch.1 and Ch.5 from Riker (from last week's reading list).*
*Note: Do not read the Erikson article. I will just discuss its main contributions during seminar.*

## Riker ##
(Chapters 1 and 5 from Riker; in compendium)


## Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson ##


## Jacobs and Page ##
* As is clear in the title, what is the research question underlying this paper? What do the authors want to know?
* What are the three views about who influences (U.S.) foreign policy? How do they differ? (107--109)
  * Which of these views involves the public as a whole? And what are the expectations thereof?
* In trying to assess whether the public's views of foreign policy matter, what do the authors highlight as the deficit in previous research? (109--110)
  * How does the data used here address that deficit?
* What is the outcome used here (i.e., the measure of influence)? (111)
* How correlated are the opinions of the public and the different elite groups? (113)
  * What impact might this have on the analysis?
  * What are the implications of high or low correlations? Does either make it easier to inference public influence?
* Which groups have the large influence on foreign policy (the public or another group)? (114--118; focus on the tables)
  * Don't worry about the secondary results (pp.118--120, Table 5)
* How credible are these results? How well do they show that the public and other groups had an influence on foreign policy?
* Can we generalize from this topic to other policy issues? And from this context to other countries? Why or why not?
* Jacobs and Page criticize Stimson et al. (121). How serious is their critique?
