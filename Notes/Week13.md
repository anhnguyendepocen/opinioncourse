# Week 13 Notes #
November 27, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

## Truman ##


## Olson ##
*We read Olson in Week 9. Please revisit your notes from that, as it is relevant here, as well.*

## Schlozman ##
*Note: This article is important for its theoretical perspective and its analytic approach. The evidence is also quite representative of the situation in other countries, though the details of specific groups are unimportant for our discussion.*

* How does Schlozman argue that representation of interest groups should be distributed? (1009--10)
* How does the distribution of political organizations in American politics correspond to the distribution of economic roles of citizens? (1012--14, Figure 1)
  * Is her comparison reasonable? (1015)
* Should groups exist proportional to the members of the public they serve? How likely would that situation be to occur, given what we know about collective action problems (from Olson), "group theory" (from Truman), and the impact of opinions on behavior?
* What are the implications of a "pressure system" that is biased toward corporations and the wealthy? How might this influence opinion-policy congruence?
