# Week 13 Notes #
November 27, 2013

## Assignment ##
Please write a 500-word essay that addresses the prompt below.

>Representation is historically defined as a one-way link between public (or public opinions specifically) and elected representatives. Yet much of the public's information about politics comes (directly or indirectly) from elected officials and other politicians. The public's views are thus endogenous to the institutions meant to represent those views. As such, representation as defined by democratic theory is impossible.

Defend, challenge, or qualify the above statement, with reference to literature from the course.

Send your essay to the two other members of your group and to the instructor by 12:00 (noon) on Tuesday. In class, you will provide feedback to each other in groups on each other's essays.


## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

## Truman ##
*Note: We covered the most important ideas from Truman during last week's class, so it is not essential to read the text.*

## Olson ##
*We read Olson in Week 9. Please revisit your notes from that, as it is relevant here, as well.*

## Schlozman ##
*Note: This article is important for its theoretical perspective and its analytic approach. The evidence is also quite representative of the situation in other countries, though the details of specific groups are unimportant for our discussion.*

* How does Schlozman argue that representation of interest groups should be distributed? (1009--10)
* How does the distribution of political organizations in American politics correspond to the distribution of economic roles of citizens? (1012--14, Figure 1)
  * Is her comparison reasonable? (1015)
* Should groups exist proportional to the members of the public they serve? How likely would that situation be to occur, given what we know about collective action problems (from Olson), "group theory" (from Truman), and the impact of opinions on behavior?
* What are the implications of a "pressure system" that is biased toward corporations and the wealthy? How might this influence opinion-policy congruence?

## Pedersen ##
* Whereas Schlozman simply looked at the composition of the interest group population. Pedersen looks at influence. Which is a better approach for understanding the role of groups in government policymaking and the representation of public opinion?
* How does the author define influence? What alternative definitions are available? (28--30)
* How does the author *measure* influence? Are there any problems with these approaches? (30--31)
 * How similar are the two measures? (35--36)
* How much influence do groups seem to have on policymaking?
* Does Pedersen miss anything by focusing on interest organizations but not accounting for opinion directly (as in Jacobs and Page's analysis from Week 12)?
