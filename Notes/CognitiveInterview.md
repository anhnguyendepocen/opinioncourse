# Cognitive Interview Activity #

For this activity, you should come up with a short questionnaire involving 5--15 opinion questions, engage in "cognitive interviewing" of that questionnaire with 2-3 (or more) respondents. These can be friends, family, or anyone. It is best that you interview them one-on-one rather than in a group.

You can come up the questions yourself and/or find questions in surveys or news reports online. It may be helpful to collaborate with one another if you have difficulty coming up with questions.

I would suggest picking a range of opinion questions, with some being easy or familiar (e.g., which political party do they support) and others being hard or unfamiliar (e.g., what is their opinion of the European Patent Court). You may want to try a few "double-barreled" questions. A range of different questions will help you to see how your respondents think about a number of unique question styles.

Some different cognitive interviewing strategies you may want to try are listed below. For each, you would ask one of your questions and then ask your respondent to do one of the following. For example, for #4 (paraphrasing), you would read the question and then ask the respondent to tell you what the question was about and what it was asking them their opinion about. You do not need to use all of the techniques.

## Possible techniques ##

1. Concurrent think-alouds (in which respondents verbalize their thoughts while they answer a question)
2. Retrospective think-alouds (in which respondents describe how they arrive at their answers either just after they provide them or at the end of the interview)
3. Confidence ratings (in which respondents assess their confidence in their answers)
4. Paraphrasing (in which respondents restate the question in their own words)
5. Definitions (in which respondents provide definitions for the key terms in the question)
6. Probes (in which respondents answer follow-up questions designed to reveal their response strategies)

## Assignment ##

Write up your questionnaire and take notes on respondents' answers to your questions (both their opinions and their responses to any of the above techniques. We will meet in groups next week to discuss and reflect on your experiences.
