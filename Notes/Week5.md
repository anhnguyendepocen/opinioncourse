## Tourangeau and Rasinski ##
[Questions will be posted on Friday]


## Bishop, Tuchfarber, and Oldendick ##
* Why should we care about the research being reported by Bishop et al? Does it matter? If so, how? If no, why not?
* What are the three different experimental conditions used by Bishop et al.? (243)
* Does their decision create conditions that you would expect *a priori* to produce lots of "don't know" responses or few? Why?
* Why do they argue that people might provide opinions to ficitious issue questions?
* What are their findings? How often do people report opinions on fictious issues?
* What implications do their findings have for interpreting public opinion data from surveys?
* What implications do their findings have for designing and implementing survey-based opinion research?
* Do any ethical considerations come to mind regarding this study? And do Bishop et al. address those considerations?


## Schuldt, Konrath, and Schwarz ##

* What do Schuldt et al. aim to do? Are they trying to understand if people distinguish "climate change" from "global warming" (i.e., that they have separate opinions about each) or that the opinions people *report* depend on how the question is asked? How well do they test that?
* What do they find? Does question wording matter? If so, how? And for whom?
* What implications does this study (and studies like it) have for interpreting opinion data from survey?
* What implications does it have for the question of whether citizens are rational or reasoned?
