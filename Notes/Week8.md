# Week 8 Notes #
October 23, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

*Note: You do not need to read Lodge, Steenbergen, and Brau - "The Responsive Voter". Consider it an optional refresher on OL models.*

## Taber and Lodge ##
* What is Bayesian reasoning/updating? How does this differ from motivated skepticism? (755)
* What is motivation? What kinds of motivation do Taber and Lodge say are at work in citizens' thinking? (756)
* What is "attitude polarization"? Why do the authors say it happens? How strong is the extant evidence for polarization? (756) Do they find any evidence for it (764--767)
* What are the authors' expectations for how motivated reasoning works? (757)
* How do the authors study motivated reasoning? How credible is their research design? (757--760)
* What issues do they use for the study? Why do they choose these issues? What impact does it have for the generalizability of their results?
* How do people evaluate attitude-congruent arguments? What about incongruent arguments? (760--761)
* Are people more likely to look at congruent or incongruent information? (763--764)
* Taber and Lodge discuss the idea of beliefs and opinions as "possessions" that people want to defend. (767) How credible is this argument and what implications does it have for the ideas of Bayesian updating, rationality, and democratic deliberation?

## Page, Shapiro, and Dempsey ##
* Page et al. talk about public opinion in the aggregate. This is a shift from much of what we've read so far. What conceptualization of public opinion (from Herbst) do they adopt?
* What assumptions do the authors make about how citizens form opinions? (23--24)
* Do the authors expect large/direct or small/indirect effects of media? Why do they focus on television? (24--25)
* What data do the authors use to look at what moves public opinion? (25--26) What is their unit of analysis?
* Do the level and unit of analysis adopted in this paper create any problems for the authors? What is the mechanism by which these aggregate results are produced?
* How do the authors measure media content? (26) How does this differ from the experimental research we've read in previous weeks? Does this increase or decrease the credibility of their research?
* How stable is aggregate opinion over-time? (28--29) What effect does media content have on opinions?
* What effect do interest groups have on opinion? (37) Does this result make sense? Why or why not?
* The authors find large effects of the Presidency. What implications does that have for anticipatory representation? Do those results generalize beyond the US?

## Healy and Malhotra ##
* Healy and Malhotra look at the effects of tornadoes on voting. Why? What's the logic here? What do tornadoes tell us about voting behavior? (194)
* Do the authors argue that this effect is irrational? Why? (195--196)
* What effect do tornadoes have vote shares? What are the separate effects of economic damage and fatalities?
* Healy and Malhotra contrast the effect of fatalities with the large effects (seen in extant research) of military casualties on government support and voting. What is the difference? And is one effect more "rational" than the other?
* If voters change their opinions in response to natural events, does this mean that their opinions are "responsive" (a good thing) or irrationally responsive to non-political activities (a bad thing)?
* What information can be considered rational for voters to use in forming political opinions?
