# Week 8 Notes #
October 23, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

*Note: You do not need to read Lodge, Steenbergen, and Brau - "The Responsive Voter". Consider it an optional refresher on OL models.*

## Taber and Lodge ##


## Page, Shapiro, and Dempsey ##


## Healy and Malhotra ##
* Healy and Malhotra look at the effects of tornadoes on voting. Why? What's the logic here? What do tornadoes tell us about voting behavior? (194)
* Do the authors argue that this effect is irrational? Why? (195--196)
* What effect do tornadoes have vote shares? What are the separate effects of economic damage and fatalities?
* Healy and Malhotra contrast the effect of fatalities with the large effects (seen in extant research) of military casualties on government support and voting. What is the difference? And is one effect more "rational" than the other?
* If voters change their opinions in response to natural events, does this mean that their opinions are "responsive" (a good thing) or irrationally responsive to non-political activities (a bad thing)?
* What information can be considered rational for voters to use in forming political opinions?
