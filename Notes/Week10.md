# Week 10 Notes #
November 6, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

## Lau and Redlawsk ##
* Lau and Redlawsk begin by contrasting "classic texts of democratic theory" with "five decades of behavioral research." What does each viewpoint say about citizens' role in democracy? Given what you now know about opinions and their role in democracy, how credible are the claimed normative implications stated by Lau and Redlawsk on p.585?
* What is the research question (and the underlying normative question) at stake in this article? (585--86)
* How do Lau and Redlawsk define a "correct" vote? Which theorist (e.g., of Mansbridge, Downs, or Dahl) does this view reflect?
  * How credible is this definition of correct voting? Can we ever define what is a "correct" vote?
* What do Lau and Redlawsk's experiments look like? Do these resemble political campaigns as you experience them? (587--88, and Figure 1)
* How do they operationalize "correct voting" in the experiment? (588-89) There are two ways. Be prepared to describe and compare both.
  * How credible are these operationalizations?
* What percent of their sample self-reports "voting correctly"? (590) What should we make of this percentage given that random voting would yield 50% "correct" voting?
* Given what we know about the effects of strong opinions on behavior (from last week's articles), do you consider the "equal-weighting" of issues approach adopted by Lau and Redlawsk to be credible?
* Looking at real world data, under what three conditions do the authors expect higher levels of correct voting? (592) Are their expectations confirmed? (593)
  * What level of "correct" voting is requisite to consider the public capable of self-government? ...to consider democracy to be of high quality?
* Do you expect that levels of correct voting will be higher or lower in other political contexts (e.g., in parliamentary systems, in multiparty systems, in systems with different media)? Why?
* If outside observers can, with information about candidates' positions and voters' interests, make "better" decisions about whom voters should elect, why do we allow (or, perhaps, force) voters to decide for themselves who should govern?
* *Note: You do not need to read the appendix.*


## Hobolt ##
* How does Hobolt define "competence" and "competent voting"? How does this compare to Lau and Redlawsk's idea of "correct" voting? (151--155)
* Table 1 shows levels of European citizens' knowledge of the EU. Should citizens be expected to know these things? And can we use that knowledge as a metric of competence? (Think back to Dahl).
* What heuristic cue (that we've seen before in Lau and Redlawsk's article from several weeks ago) does Hobolt focus on?
* Hobolt distinguishes between "issue-specific" and "second-order" voting on the EU. What are these two different forms of voting? Is one normatively superior? (157--158)
 * If people vote in different ways (i.e., the model of vote choice varies across voters), can we interpret election results as expressions of public opinion?
* Hobolt describes the dimensionality of EU politics. What are the two dimensions? (161--165) What does she ultimately find about how voters use these dimensions in voting in EU referenda?
 * How well to citizens' preferences map onto the positions of their preferred party (on both dimensions)? (165--166)
* How do information and cues affect citizens' voting on the EU referendum? Are the effects of cues homogeneous or heterogeneous across the electorate?


## Sniderman ##
* What is "minimalism" according to Sniderman? (67)
* According to Sniderman, how are citizens able to make political decisions in spite of the complexity of policy questions?
* Sniderman questions the idea from Dahl (and Lau and Redlawsk) that citizens can know their own interests (72). He introduces the "self-help heuristic" as an example (you might know it better as the "deservingness" heuristic, from earlier in the course). Is it indeed tautological to argue that citizens can make effective decisions if they can rely on heuristics like deservingness? Are the heuristics themselves judgments that some citizens cannot make?
* How does Sniderman distinguish economic (decision-theoretic) tasks from public/political choice tasks? Which are easy and which are hard? (75-77)
 * According to Sniderman, what distinguishes Kahneman and Tversky-style probabilistic choices from most political choices?
* What role does the political system have in helping citizens form opinions and translate opinions into voting decisions? (68--69, 81)
* What are the four characteristics of public opinion described by Sniderman (and summarized on p.83)?
* According to Sniderman, what are the tasks citizens are actually expected to do in a democracy? (74--75) What do these tasks mean for how we should theorize, study, and critique opinions and vote choices?

## Disch ##
*Disch is very interesting, but consider it optional. It expands upon ideas we read earlier by Mansbridge.*
