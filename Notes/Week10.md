# Week 10 Notes #
November 6, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

## Lau and Redlawsk ##
* Lau and Redlawsk begin by contrasting "classic texts of democratic theory" with "five decades of behavioral research." What does each viewpoint say about citizens' role in democracy? Given what you now know about opinions and their role in democracy, how credible are the claimed normative implications stated by Lau and Redlawsk on p.585?
* What is the research question (and the underlying normative question) at stake in this article? (585--86)
* How do Lau and Redlawsk define a "correct" vote? Which theorist (e.g., of Mansbridge, Downs, or Dahl) does this view reflect?
  * How credible is this definition of correct voting? Can we ever define what is a "correct" vote?
* What do Lau and Redlawsk's experiments look like? Do these resemble political campaigns as you experience them? (587--88, and Figure 1)
* How do they operationalize "correct voting" in the experiment? (588-89) There are two ways. Be prepared to describe and compare both.
  * How credible are these operationalizations?
* What percent of their sample self-reports "voting correctly"? (590) What should we make of this percentage given that random voting would yield 50% "correct" voting?
* Given what we know about the effects of strong opinions on behavior (from last week's articles), do you consider the "equal-weighting" of issues approach adopted by Lau and Redlawsk to be credible?
* Looking at real world data, under what three conditions do the authors expect higher levels of correct voting? (592) Are their expectations confirmed? (593)
  * What level of "correct" voting is requisite to consider the public capable of self-government? ...to consider democracy to be of high quality?
* Do you expect that levels of correct voting will be higher or lower in other political contexts (e.g., in parliamentary systems, in multiparty systems, in systems with different media)? Why?
* If outside observers can, with information about candidates' positions and voters' interests, make "better" decisions about whom voters should elect, why do we allow (or, perhaps, force) voters to decide for themselves who should govern?
* *Note: You do not need to read the appendix.*

## Sniderman ##


## Disch ##
*Disch is very interesting, but consider it optional. It expands upon ideas we read earlier by Mansbridge.*
