* What is "political awareness"? How does Zaller measure it? What concerns might we have with this construct and its operationalization?
* How does Zaller characterize politics (47) and how does that reality compare the "issue involvement" experiment he describes on p.46? What do any differences imply for how citizens respond to elite influence?
 * Think especially about argument strength, involvement, and information levels
* Is Zaller's model explaining opinion formation or just opinion *responding* (as in a survey interview)?
* Zaller describes his model as "cognitive" as opposed to "affective"? How appropriate is this distinction? What implications does it have?
* Zaller's model is a "memory-based" (MB) model, according to Druckman and Lupia. How does it compare to an online (OL) model (50)?

### Lau and Redlawsk

### General Questions
* How credible are the online versus memory-based models of opinion formation? Zaller offers his view (50); what do you think?
