## Other notes/questions on readings ##

### Druckman and Lupia

### Eagly and Chaiken
* How do Eagly and Chaiken define "attitude" (269)?
* Do Eagly and Chaiken say attitudes are formed and retrieved online or through a memory-based process, or something else? (esp. 270--71)
* What are the three parts of the "tripartite" model of attitude structure? (271--75) Do attitudes need all three parts?
* On p.273, Eagly and Chaiken discuss whether individuals are aware of the position of their attitudes on scales. What do they think? Much of their disussion also focuses on single "attiude objects" as opposed to sets of alternative (policy) positions. How does their view of attitudes compare to the definition of preferences advanced by Druckman and Lupia?
* Are "beliefs" to Eagly and Chaiken the same as what "considerations" are to Zaller?
* Eagly and Chaiken spend a lot of time discussing varieties of attitudinal consistency and the empirical evidence for each (276--281). Other scholars (like Philip Converse, see 277) propose that consistency may have normative implications for democracy? Is it important for individuals to have consistent attitudes? What might be (dis)advantages to consistency, inconsistency, and ambivalence?
* How do Eagly and Chaiken define attitude "strength"? How does it compare with attitude extremity? (287)
 * What are two different approaches to measuring strength? And how do they differ? (287, 288)
 * What are the various forms of attitude strength?
* *We did not read pp.295--303 on attitude-behavior linkages. We'll revisit them in a few weeks*
* Why do people hold attitudes? What are some different attitude functions? (303--6)
 * If attitudes serve an "object-appraisal" function, how would people operate (in politics, or everyday life) without attitudes?


### Zaller
* When Zaller talks about opinions, does he mean attitudes (as in Eagly and Chaiken's definition), preferences (as in Druckman and Lupia's definition), or something else?
* What are the four axioms of Zaller's model? How tenable is each?
 * Reception (42)
 * Resistance (44)
 * Accessibility (48)
 * Response (49)
* How does the "response" axiom compare to the "expectancy-value model" of attitudes described by Eagly and Chaiken (275)?
* What is "political awareness"? How does Zaller measure it? What concerns might we have with this construct and its operationalization?
* How does Zaller characterize politics (47) and how does that reality compare the "issue involvement" experiment he describes on p.46? What do any differences imply for how citizens respond to elite influence?
 * Think especially about argument strength, involvement, and information levels
* Is Zaller's model explaining opinion formation or just opinion *responding* (as in a survey interview)?
* Zaller describes his model as "cognitive" as opposed to "affective"? How appropriate is this distinction? What implications does it have?
* Zaller's model is a "memory-based" (MB) model, according to Druckman and Lupia. How does it compare to an online (OL) model (50)?

### Lau and Redlawsk

### General Questions
* How credible are the online versus memory-based models of opinion formation? Zaller offers his view (50); what do you think?
* Are opinions affective, cognitive, or both? Why?
