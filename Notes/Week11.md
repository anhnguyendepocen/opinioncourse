# Week 11 Notes #
November 13, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

*Note: We will read Ch.1 and Ch.5 from Riker next week (Week 12) instead.*

## Druckman and Leeper ##
* What is the main question that the authors are interested in exploring? (50,53)
  * How do the authors define stability? (53)
* What are the two main perspectives on public opinion that the authors consider? (51) What is the unit of analysis in each? (51,53)
* What are the normative implications of micro-level instability (e.g., in response to framing)? (52)
* At the micro-level, what factors make opinions stable over time? (53--54, Table 1)
  * How to strong and weak attitudes respond to framing attempts? (57--58, FIgures 2 & 3)
* What factors do the authors argue contribute to the "micro instability/macro stability" contradiction? (55--61)
  * Why is macro opinion less sensitive to measurement error than micro opinion? (55)
  * We typically think of surveys sampling individuals to participate in the survey. The authors discuss two other kinds of sampling. What are they and why do they matter? (56--57)
  * What is ecological validity? And how is it relevant to macro and micro opinion studies? (60--61)
* How is our understanding of macro-level opinion dynamics constrained by the volume of survey interviews (and, indirectly, on the volume of issue-relevant media coverage)? (57--58, Figure 1)
* Druckman and Leeper briefly discuss the use of public opinion by politicians (62). How does their advice relate to Herbst's discussions of public opinion as a symbol?
* The authors mention that "strong opinions and stability are often seen as signs of an engaged and thoughtful citizenry - coveted attributes. Attitude strenght promotes constraint and engagement." (62) Does this mean that stability of opinions should be seen as a normative good? Why or why not?


## Page and Shapiro ##
*Note: Read just chapter 10: "Democracy, Information, and the Rational Public."*


## Mackuen, Erikson, and Stimson ##
*Note: Just glance at the first few pages of this article to learn the definition of "macropartisanship". The heavy discussion of American politics in the remainder of the article distracts too much from the core theoretical contribution I want you to see.*

## Gilens ##
* Unlike the readings for Week 8, which focused on individuals' responses to information, Gilens focuses on macro-level responses to information. I.e., what would the aggregate policy preference of the electorate be if the public were better informed?
* Gilens focuses on policy-specific information. Why? What does he see as the problems with measures of citizens' (general) political knowledge? (379--380)
 * How does Gilens measure policy-specific information/knowledge? (380--81)
 * How does Gilens measure general political knowledge? (382)
 * How correlated are the two measures? (Table 1)
* Gilens focuses on changing peoples' "knowledge" of political "facts" rather than changing their beliefs or perceptions about reality. Is this important?
* How does Gilens analyze the effects of information on opinions? What do the regression models include (in terms of outcomes and independent variables)? (383--84)
* Gilens uses an "imputation" method to predict what a respondent's opinion would be if they were better informed. What assumptions do we need to make to believe this evidence? Is it a credible prediction? (384, Table 2)
* What effect do general knowledge and policy-specific knowledge have on macro opinion? (Table 2)
* In his second study, Gilens conducts an experiment on information exposure. How do the results from the experiment compare to the "imputation" results from his first study? How does this affect the credibility of the first results? (385--87, Table 3)
* For what subset of the electorate does policy-specific information have the largest effects? (388, Tables 4 and 5)
 * How do the analyses presented in Tables 4 and 5 differ? At what levels of policy-specific knowledge is opinion being imputed?
* Given Gilens's results, consider the following:
 * Which opinions are better, those that people have or those that people would have if fully informed? Can we actually know what those counterfactual opinions would be?
 * What should be done about political ignorance? And can anything be done?
