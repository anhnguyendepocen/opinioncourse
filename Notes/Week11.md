# Week 11 Notes #
November 13, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

*Note: We will read Ch.1 and Ch.5 from Riker next week (Week 12) instead.*

## Druckman and Leeper ##
* What is the main question that the authors are interested in exploring? (50,53)
  * How do the authors define stability? (53)
* What are the two main perspectives on public opinion that the authors consider? (51) What is the unit of analysis in each? (51,53)
* What are the normative implications of micro-level instability (e.g., in response to framing)? (52)
* At the micro-level, what factors make opinions stable over time? (53--54, Table 1)
  * How to strong and weak attitudes respond to framing attempts? (57--58, FIgures 2 & 3)
* What factors do the authors argue contribute to the "micro instability/macro stability" contradiction? (55--61)
  * Why is macro opinion less sensitive to measurement error than micro opinion? (55)
  * We typically think of surveys sampling individuals to participate in the survey. The authors discuss two other kinds of sampling. What are they and why do they matter? (56--57)
  * What is ecological validity? And how is it relevant to macro and micro opinion studies? (60--61)
* How is our understanding of macro-level opinion dynamics constrained by the volume of survey interviews (and, indirectly, on the volume of issue-relevant media coverage)? (57--58, Figure 1)
* Druckman and Leeper briefly discuss the use of public opinion by politicians (62). How does their advice relate to Herbst's discussions of public opinion as a symbol?
* The authors mention that "strong opinions and stability are often seen as signs of an engaged and thoughtful citizenry - coveted attributes. Attitude strenght promotes constraint and engagement." (62) Does this mean that stability of opinions should be seen as a normative good? Why or why not?


## Page and Shapiro ##
*Note: Read just chapter 10: "Democracy, Information, and the Rational Public."*
