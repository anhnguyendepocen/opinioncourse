# Readings #

## Riker and Ordeshook ##
* *Note: Don't worry about the math in Section III.*
* What variables do Riker and Ordeshook say influence voting? (25) Are these factors sufficient to explain the decision to vote? If yes, why? If not, what is left out?
* Under what conditions does their model expect people to vote? (25--26)
* What is the D term? (28)
* How do the authors test their theory? (Sections IV-VI) What do they find?
* Does their model completely explain all behavior or is there still some irrationality? (39)


## Olson ##
* Why do political groups exist according to Olson? (5)
* Olson makes draws an analogy between political groups and firms in a competitive market? What does he mean? (9-11)
* Olson's major assumption/thesis is in italics on p.11. What does he argue about individuals' and firms' interests?
* What are public goods and why do they matter for groups? And why do they matter for individuals' willingness to give resources to groups? (13--15)
* Olson's main contribution is the idea of the "collective action problem." (16) What is it?
* What is "the traditional theory of groups" according to Olson? (16-21) How does Olson's perpective differ?
* *Note: I've excluded a math-heavy portion of the text that is summarized in nontechnical language on pp.33--36)*
* What is the distinction between "inclusive" and "exclusive" groups? (36--42) How do individual members contribute to and benefit from each type of group?
* The last part of the selection (pp.60-65) covers Olson's (partial) solution to the collective action problem. What is it?

*Please read the section on behavior (pp.295--303) from Eagly and Chaiken (Week 3)*

## Fazio and Towles-Schwen ##
* What are the two categories of attitude-behavior processes the authors discuss? How do they compare? (97, 99--100)
* In deliberative processes, what factors shape peoples' decisions to act? (99)
* What is the MODE model? Is it deliberative or spontaneous? (100)
