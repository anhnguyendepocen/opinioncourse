# Readings

## Jost, Federico, and Napier
* How do the authors define "ideology"? (309)
* What does it mean for citizens to have ideological belief systems? Is it important that citizens be ideological?
* Does knowing one's own interests (as Dahl discussed) require citizens to be ideological?
* How many dimensions are there to ideology? (310--13)
* What is the difference between "symbolic" and "operational" ideology? (312, 314) What implications does this have for interpreting public opinion? Do citizens have to be coherent for their views to be meaningful, or for their views to be representable?
* How do the political science and psychological approaches to the study of ideology compare? (313--23) What are the implications of either the "top-down" or "bottom-up" approaches for Dahl's democratic theory or Downs's requirement of rational decision-making?
* What conditions seem to increase political conservativism? (319--21)
* What implications does the transmission of ideology socially (e.g., from parents to children via socialization) or genetically have for interpretting public opinion? If citizens' views are shaped by processes over which they have no control, are their opinions meaningful?
* How does ideology influence political evaluations and opinions? (324--27)
* If (conservative) ideology is linked to prejudicial opinions and system-justifying rationalizations, can either liberalism or conservatism be seen as normatively or morally superior? Does your answer change if you consider that conservatism seems to be more automatic than liberalism (319)?

## Feldman
* What are the three values that Feldman examines? How are they defined? (419)
* Do the values that Feldman discusses translate well into Danish society and politics, or any other context?
* Feldman focuses mainly on economic values. Does this miss anything? Think, in particular, about Jost et al.'s discussion of the dimensionality of ideology.
* How does Feldman measure values? How does he analyze their relationships to one another?
* How stable is equality over time? (424--25)
* Feldman contrasts a focus on values with a focus on ideology. Are they distinct or is this purely semantic? Think especially, given any evidence for relationships between values and ideology (426--27).
* Feldman reports models regressing opinions (on many issues) on values, party identification, and ideology (428). What do these results show? What implications do the results have for understanding the structure of political opinions?
* Feldman then reports models regressing retrospective evaluations of the government on the same predictors (430). If performance is evaluated according to stable values, ideology, and/or partisanship, what implications does this have for representation?
* Do the relationships reported by equality and retrospective evaluations make sense (i.e., are voters being rational)? (430)
* Feldman's goal is to show that opinions (despite not being structured ideologically), do have some kind of structure. How well does he succeed in demonstrating that? Why?

## Smith et al.
* *Don't worry too much about the structural equation models (24--28). They're not important for us.*
* How does behavioral genetics research analyze the "heritability" of traits? (18--19)
* What is the equal environments assumption? Why does it matter? (19)
* How do the authors measure ideology? (21 for the first study; 23 for the second study) How does this differ from Jost et al.?
* Smith et al. are talking about genotypes and phenotypes. Which do they actually observe and does it matter? Can we study the genetic basis of opinions without observing genes?
* If genes explain ideology and/or opinions, why should we have democratic institutions? Mansbridge talks about the importance of deliberation in order for representation to occur. If opinions are substantially genetically based, what role is there for deliberation?
* By contrast, if biology plays no roles in attitudes, is it normatively superior to find that the environment explains all attitudes?
* Overall, how convincing is Smith et al.'s defense of (some of) the main criticisms of genetic research on opinions?
