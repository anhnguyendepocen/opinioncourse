# Readings

## Jost, Federico, and Napier
* How do the authors define "ideology"? (309)
* What does it mean for citizens to have ideological belief systems? Is it important that citizens be ideological?
* Does knowing one's own interests (as Dahl discussed) require citizens to be ideological?
* How many dimensions are there to ideology? (310--13)
* What is the difference between "symbolic" and "operational" ideology? (312, 314) What implications does this have for interpreting public opinion? Do citizens have to be coherent for their views to be meaningful, or for their views to be representable?
* How do the political science and psychological approaches to the study of ideology compare? (313--23) What are the implications of either the "top-down" or "bottom-up" approaches for Dahl's democratic theory or Downs's requirement of rational decision-making?
* What conditions seem to increase political conservativism? (319--21)
* What implications does the transmission of ideology socially (e.g., from parents to children via socialization) or genetically have for interpretting public opinion? If citizens' views are shaped by processes over which they have no control, are their opinions meaningful?
* How does ideology influence political evaluations and opinions? (324--27)
* If (conservative) ideology is linked to prejudicial opinions and system-justifying rationalizations, can either liberalism or conservatism be seen as normatively or morally superior? Does your answer change if you consider that conservatism seems to be more automatic than liberalism (319)?
