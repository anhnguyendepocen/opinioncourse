# Readings #

## Petersen et al. ##
* What is "deservingness"? (24--25)
* What is the deservigness heuristic? (26)
* How does the deservigness heuristic interact with individuals' political values?
* The authors say the deservingness heuristic is "automatic". What does this mean? (27--28) How do they test this? (39)
* How do the authors study the deservigness heuristic? How credible is this approach? How well does it help us understand how people form opinions about welfare (or opinions about policies generally)?
* The paper includes two studies. What are the results? Are they consistent or are there any differences?
* How much do features of the welfare recipients matter for opinions about welfare policy? (see esp. Tables 1 and 2)
* Do their results suggest that opinions are constrained by values (e.g., egalitarianism) or not? Does this mean citizens have reasoned opinions or not? (e.g., 36--38)
* Lau and Redlawsk had argued that some heuristics require sophistication in order to use them effectively whereas sometimes the sophisticated are misled by heuristics. How does sophistication affect the deservingness heuristic?

## Gerber et al. ##


## Chong and Druckman ##
* What is framing? And what is a "framing effect"? (637)
* Does framing mean that citizens have reasoned opinions, or not? Why?
* What are the possible expectations about which arguments when in political debate? (639)
* What three conditions do Chong and Druckman argue are necessary for arguments to be effective? (639)
* What is a strong frame? And what makes it strong?
* Do frames help citizens form value-consistent opinions or do they undermine value-consistent reasoning? (645, 647, 649--650)
* Which frames/arguments are most influential? Does competition between arguments matter for what opinions citizens form? If so, how and under what conditions?
* Does elite debate help or inhibit citizens' ability to reason about political issues?
* Many people worry that framing effects demonstrate the fragility of human reasoning. What do the authors think? And what do you think?
