# Week 5 Notes #
October 9, 2013

## General questions ##
* Did you learn anything from this week's readings? If so, what?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most compelling?
* What aspect(s) of this week's readings did you find the most difficult or challenging?


# Readings #

## Petersen et al. ##
* What is "deservingness"? (24--25)
* What is the deservigness heuristic? (26)
* How does the deservigness heuristic interact with individuals' political values?
* The authors say the deservingness heuristic is "automatic". What does this mean? (27--28) How do they test this? (39)
* How do the authors study the deservigness heuristic? How credible is this approach? How well does it help us understand how people form opinions about welfare (or opinions about policies generally)?
* The paper includes two studies. What are the results? Are they consistent or are there any differences?
* How much do features of the welfare recipients matter for opinions about welfare policy? (see esp. Tables 1 and 2)
* Do their results suggest that opinions are constrained by values (e.g., egalitarianism) or not? Does this mean citizens have reasoned opinions or not? (e.g., 36--38)
* Lau and Redlawsk had argued that some heuristics require sophistication in order to use them effectively whereas sometimes the sophisticated are misled by heuristics. How does sophistication affect the deservingness heuristic?

## Gerber et al. ##
* What are Gerber et al. trying to understand in this article? Why do we care about their research?
* How has past research studied the connection between media messages and opinions? And what has that research found? (136--137)
* On pp.137--138, the authors describe the context of the study. Does this seem like a good context for studying media effects on opinions? And do the results generalize to the study of media influence generally?
* How do the authors manipulate media exposure? (139--140)
* What is their unit of analysis? Is it individuals, districts, media markets, or something else?
* *Do not worry too much about the different model specifications on pp.143. Understanding them is not critical.*
* What is the outcome measure used in the study? Is this a good measure of opinion?
* What effect does media have on voters' opinions? Is that effect conditional at all? (see Tables) How long lasting are the effects of media?
* The authors contrast two perspectives on how media influence citizens (148). What are the two perspectives? How do they compare? And which do the authors find support for?

## Chong and Druckman ##
* What is framing? And what is a "framing effect"? (637)
* Does framing mean that citizens have reasoned opinions, or not? Why?
* What are the possible expectations about which arguments when in political debate? (639)
* What three conditions do Chong and Druckman argue are necessary for arguments to be effective? (639)
* What is a strong frame? And what makes it strong?
* Do frames help citizens form value-consistent opinions or do they undermine value-consistent reasoning? (645, 647, 649--650)
* Which frames/arguments are most influential? Does competition between arguments matter for what opinions citizens form? If so, how and under what conditions?
* Does elite debate help or inhibit citizens' ability to reason about political issues?
* Many people worry that framing effects demonstrate the fragility of human reasoning. What do the authors think? And what do you think?
