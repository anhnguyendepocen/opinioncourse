# Problem Set 3: Experimentation #

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this problem set is to assess your understanding of one key method of quantitative public opinion research: experimental design and analysis.

## Overview ##

You are asked to watch a short slidecast covering relevant material and then complete the following tasks. Questions regarding this material should be raised on the Moodle discussion board (https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=521541) or in instructor office hours.

## Your Task ##

 1. In your own words, explain the "fundamental problem of causal inference" and how experiments provide a solution to that problem.
 
 2. How do we know if randomization "worked"? In other words, how do we know that experimental groups are identical to one another except for the manipulated variable?
 
 3. [something about estimating a treatment effect]
 
   a. 
   
   b. [standardized mean difference]
 
 4. The statistical power of a two-sample t-test (which is, in essence, the power of a posttest-only, two-group experimental design) is influenced by four things: the size of each experimental group, the difference-in-means (i.e., difference in mean values of the outcome in the two groups), the variance of the outcome measure, and alpha (the significance level or "Type 1" error probability).
 
   a. If alpha (the Type 1 error probability) is 0.05, how often should we expect to find a "statistically significant" effect size when one is not present?
   
   b. If you increase the size of your treatment groups in an experiment while the expected effect size remains unchanged, what happens to the power of your experiment? Are you more or less likely to obtain a "false negative" result? What about "false positives"?
   
   c. Imagine we are expecting to find a small effect but we can only collect a small number of observations in our experiment, so the minimum detectable effect size in our study is larger than the effect size we would expect to observe given our theory. If our experiment reveals an effect that is statistically distinguishable from zero, what are the two possible interpretations of this result?
   
 5. Consider an experiment in which the effect of a treatment is measured using a single survey question. Assuming a given effect size, and that we cannot change alpha or the size of the experimental groups, what practical action can we do to increase the power of our experimental design?
