# Problem Set 2: Macro Analysis #

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this problem set is to assess your understanding of one key method of quantitative public opinion research: cross-sectional and panel regression analysis.

## Overview ##

You are asked to watch a short slidecast covering relevant material and then complete the following tasks. Questions regarding this material should be raised on the Moodle discussion board (https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=521541) or in instructor office hours.

## Your Task ##

 1. Thinking of different ways of designing public opinion research, define "cross-sectional design," "repeated cross-sectional design," and "panel design". Identify the advantages and disadvantages of each design.
 
 2. Consider the following hypothetical data on attitudes toward the European Union (measured on a scale from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater positivity toward the EU) in the UK and in Germany collected at two points in time.
 
   - Germany, time 1: .7
   - Germany, time 2: .8
   - United Kingdom, time 1: .6
   - United Kingdom, time 2: .4
   
   a. Assuming repeated cross-sectional surveys of n = 2500 in each country and a margin of error of +/- .02, what is the standard deviation
 
 [assess whether an over-time change is statistically significant; using raw data and using top-lines]
 
   c. How much farther apart are the UK and Germany at time 2 than they were at time 1?
   
   d. Are the differences between the UK and Germany at each time point (i.e., separately for time 1 and time 2) statistically significant?
   
   e. If the data were instead collected from a panel (i.e., the same respondents interviewed twice) and we re-estimated the difference using a within-subjects t-test, would we obtain a more precise or less precise estimate of the over-time change? Why? What information (not provided here) would you need to calculate that test statistic? 
 
 3. [estimate a regression coefficient for a simple bivariate relationship]
 
 4. [interpret a regression coefficient]
 
 5. Something about panel regression
