# Lesson 7: Emotion and/or Cognition

## Welcome

## Background literature

 - Today's discussion builds out of last week's discussion of the cold cognition model of reasoning
    - Is this it?
 - Implicit versus explicit processes
    - System 1 processes are implicit, fast, emotional, etc.
    - System 2 processes are explicit, slow, cognitive, etc.
 - Emotion ("affect") as a component of reasoning
    - Normative debates of emotionality
        - Enlightenment notions of rationality as a psychological ideal
        - Anti-democratic argumentation that the public as excessively passionate
        - Propaganda theories that suggest emotionality runs against reasoned debate
    - Emotions as outcomes versus causes versus processes
    - Competing models
        - Emotions as epiphenomenal to reasoning
        - Explicit reasoning as epiphenomenal to implicit or emotional processes
        - Emotion and cognition as complementary
    - What are the emotions that are relevant for reasoning?
        - Valence models (positive or negative)
        - Discrete emotion models
            - Lerner and Keltner
            - Affective Intelligence Theory (AIT)
        - What effects do emotions have?
        - Emotions versus moods versus traits
    - How do we study the role of emotions?
        - Observational, self-report
        - Behavioural and physiological
        - Experimental


## Discussion questions

 - What is the set of emotions that are relevant to reasoning?
 - How do emotions influence reasoning, if at all?
 - Can emotional reasoning be considered rational?
 - Do we consider emotions to be a positive or negative contribution to *political* reasoning?
