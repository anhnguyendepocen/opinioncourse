# Lesson 8: Identity, values, and other predispositions

## Welcome

## Background literature

 - Columbia School was focused on external determinants of opinions and behavior
 - Michigan School shifted focus to psychological determinants of vote choice
    - Childhood socialization
    - Party identification and attachment
    - Left-right/liberal-conservative ideology
 - Subsequence research, particularly in social psychology, expanded scope of possible predispostions
    - Values (sometimes "core values")
    - Self-interest
    - Social identities and group attachments beyond party
    - Racial self-identification
    - Religiosity
    - Gender
    - Genetics
 - A number of big questions in this space
    - Descriptive: "how do those with different predispositions differ in their attitudes?"
    - Structural: "what is the structure of political values?"
    - Causal: "how much of opinion Y can be explained by X?"
 - Predispositions represent a tricky causal inference problem
    - How do we establish something that is fixed (like sex or ethnicity) as a cause of opinions?
    - What do we even mean when we say a predisposition is a cause?
    - Are predispositions fixed or can they change?
 - Resurgence in interest in mid-2000s in "biopolitics"
    - Physiological mechanisms, causes, and outcomes
    - Genetic and epigenetic explanations for political "phenotypes"
    - Dominant methods involve twin studies

## Discussion questions

 - What is the set of predispositions that are relevant to opinion formation?
 - What is an "identity"? Through what mechanisms might an identity (or set of identities) influence opinions?
 - What are "values"? Are they different from attitudes? from motivations?
 - If a significant amount of variation in opinions is explained by genetics, what does that mean for politics?

## Wrap-up

 - Research project discussion
    - Mini lecture on giving a presentation
    - Example presentation
