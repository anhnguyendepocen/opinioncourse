# Lesson 3: Attitudes

## Welcome

## Overview of attitudes

 - This is the most psychologically technical week!

 - History
   - Attitudes have been one of the most important concepts on social psychology since the 1930s
   - Disagreement about what an attitude is, but also disagreement about:
        - Attitude structure or mental representation
        - Attitude functions (why attitudes?)
        - Attitudes as causes of behaviour
        - Attitudes in relationship to other mental representations, such as values, beliefs, knowledge, goals, preferences
        - Strength-related characteristics of attitudes
   - Terminology differences across disciplines
        - Attitude
        - Opinion
        - Preference
        - Value
        - Viewpoint
        - Predisposition
