# Public Opinion Seminar #

This repository holds materials for a course on public opinion. The initial version of this course is being conducted as a master seminar at Aarhus University during Autumn term 2013.

## Syllabus ##

You can find an outline of the course objectives, schedule for the course, and assigned readings in the [Syllabus](/Syllabus.pdf).


## Slides and Notes ##

PDF versions of course slides (and the LaTeX sources for those slides) are available in the [/Slides](Slides) directory.
Some rough notes for each day's discussion are posted a day or so before class in the [/Notes](Notes) directory.

Following a summing up of the day's discussions, each class will end with a "preview" lecture of the next week's reading materials.


## Weekly Assignments ##

Each week one student will write a short (less than one double-spaced page) response to whatever they find interesting or important from that week's readings. This will be due on Monday before class. Another student will respond however they see fit (i.e., agree, disagree, highlight other readings or perspectives, etc.) in a short (less than one double-spaced page) due Wednesday morning (by 12:00 noon). Papers should be distributed via email to all course participants.

Class will start each week with these students discussing their papers. All students should read the papers before class.



## Why GitHub? ##

The motivation behind building a syllabus and materials on GitHub is free dissemination of course materials for the benefit of other instructors and students. With this in mind, this repository is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). Materials from this repository can be forked, copied, reused, and modified in any way at any time for any purpose, provided attribution back to the original author is included *and* any derivative works are released under a similar license (i.e., don't pass any of this off as your own work and don't place additional copyright restrictions on the use of any derivative works).

My plan is to create branches (or forks) for each iteration of the course and merge the most recent version back into the master branch, preserving each version of the course separately for posterity.

The Chronicle of Higher Education's [ProfHacker blog](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/tag/github) has discussed the potential for GitHub for this kind of course. Their posts might be helpful to anyone who is interested in this kind of course sharing but who is unfamiliar with git and GitHub.
