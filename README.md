Course materials for Public Opinion seminar
=======

This repository will hold materials for a course on public opinion. I'm teaching an initial version of this course as a master seminar at Aarhus University during Autumn term 2013. My plan is to create branches for each iteration of the course and merge the most recent version back into the master branch, preserving each version of the course separately for posterity.

## Motivation ##

The motivation behind building a syllabus and materials on GitHub is free dissemination of course materials for the benefit of other instructors and students. With this in mind, this repository is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). Materials from this repository can be forked, copied, reused, and modified in any way at any time for any purpose, provided attribution back to the original author is included *and* any derivative works are released under a similar license (i.e., don't pass any of this off as your own work and don't place additional copyright restrictions on the use of any derivative works).

The Chronicle of Higher Education's [ProfHacker blog](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/tag/github) has discussed the potential for GitHub for this kind of course. Their posts might be helpful to anyone who is interested in this kind of course sharing but who is unfamiliar with git and GitHub.
